<h1>How to Skip Any Level in Nealfun I am not a Robot game</h1>

<p>Many players get stuck and search for how to skip a level in I am not a robot game. This method is often called a Nealfun cheat or trick, and it works by editing your browser storage. Here are the direct steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open <a href="https://neal.fun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nealfun</a> and start the game.</li>
<li>Press <b>F12</b> on your keyboard to open DevTools.</li>
<li>Go to the <b>Application</b> tab, then <b>Local Storage</b>, then click <code>https://neal.fun</code>.</li>
<img src="https://aniketxraj.me/step_1.webp" alt="nealfun skip level guide step 1 using DevTools">
<li>Find the key <b>not-a-robot-level</b>.</li>
<img src="https://aniketxraj.me/final.webp" alt="nealfun local storage not a robot level key">
<li>Change its value to one less than the level you want. Example: set <b>7</b> to reach level 8.</li>
<li>Press Enter, reload the page, and you will be at your new level.</li>
</ol>

<div class="note">
<strong>Example:</strong> To jump to level 10, set the value to 9. Refresh and you will land on level 10.
</div>

<h2>Console Shortcut</h2>
<p>If you prefer the Console, paste this line (replace <b>N</b> with your target level minus one). This is the fastest way to apply the Nealfun cheat code:</p>
<pre>localStorage.setItem('not-a-robot-level', String(N))
location.reload()</pre>

<h2>Level Value Table</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Value You Set</th><th>Level You Jump To</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Level 7</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>Level 8</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Level 9</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Level 10</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Level 11</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
<li>If the key is not there, play once so the game creates it.</li>
<li>If nothing changes, clear local storage and try again.</li>
<li>Use <code>Object.keys(localStorage)</code> in Console to see available keys.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Extra Info</h2>
<p>Why this works: Nealfun saves your progress in your browser. By editing that saved number, you tell the game you already cleared a certain stage, so it pushes you to the next one. This trick is often called a Nealfun hack, but it is really just a local browser change.</p>

<h2>Responsible Use</h2>
<p>This trick only changes your local browser data. It does not affect Nealfun servers. Use it for learning, testing, or exploration, not for ruining the fun entirely.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<div>
<h3>Can you skip levels in Nealfun?</h3>
<p>Yes, by editing local storage you can change the <code>not-a-robot-level</code> value to move to the next stage instantly.</p>

<h3>Is skipping Nealfun levels safe?</h3>
<p>Yes, it is safe because it only affects your own browser storage and not the Nealfun servers.</p>

<h3>Will this trick work on mobile?</h3>
<p>Most mobile browsers do not have the Application tab, so this Nealfun trick usually only works on desktop.</p>
</div>

<section style="margin-top:38px;">
<h2>Conclusion & Further Considerations</h2>
<p>
Skipping levels in Nealfun can be a useful technique for players who are interested in exploring different stages, testing the game, or overcoming a particularly challenging level. While the process leverages basic browser features available to all users, it is important to remember that this method is intended for educational and recreational purposes only. Using this approach helps you understand how client-side storage works in web applications, and how games like Nealfun keep track of your progress.
</p>
<p>
If you are a developer or someone interested in web security, experimenting with localStorage provides valuable insight into how browser data can be manipulated. This knowledge is also helpful for debugging, prototyping, or learning about web development in general. However, always respect the intended spirit of the game and the work of its creators. Cheating excessively can diminish the enjoyment and challenge that games are designed to deliver.
</p>
<p>
We encourage users to use this information responsibly. Remember that this method does not provide any advantage over other players, as it only affects your local browser session and cannot be used to compete unfairly or alter the experience for others. Additionally, browser updates or changes to the Nealfun website could affect the steps described here, so always proceed with caution and stay updated on best practices for browser troubleshooting.
</p>
<p>
If you encounter any issues, feel free to revisit the troubleshooting section above or seek assistance from relevant online communities. For further reading about browser storage, JavaScript debugging, and ethical hacking practices, consider exploring web development documentation and tutorials. By understanding both the technical and ethical aspects, you can enhance your digital literacy while enjoying your favorite games.

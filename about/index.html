  <h1>About This Site</h1>
  <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Aniket Kumar Raj</strong>, a student and aspiring software engineer who enjoys coding, experimenting with web projects, and creating fun digital experiences. This website is my personal corner of the internet where I share interactive games, coding projects, and useful resources.</p>

  <p>I started this site with simple experiments like browser-based games (including the 2048 remake) and gradually added guides, strategies, and articles to make it both fun and informative. My goal is to combine creativity with learning, so that visitors can enjoy playing while also discovering how things work behind the scenes.</p>

  <p>Beyond games, I’m also passionate about technology, cybersecurity, and building tools that make the internet safer and more enjoyable. This website is part of that journey, and I hope it inspires other learners and developers to explore their own ideas.</p>

  <p>Thanks for visiting—stay curious and keep experimenting!</p>
